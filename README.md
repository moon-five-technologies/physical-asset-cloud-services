## Physical Asset OpenAPI generated server
### Moon Five Technologies Inc 

## Setup
1. Retrieve the firebase admin sdk private key, add this file to the `/openapi_server/keys` folder under the name `firebase_auth_key.json`.
2. Set environmental variables POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD, TMP_API_SECRET_KEY that can be accessed within the docker-compose container. This can be done by creating a file `~/env.txt`, which houses this information with every new line looking like `VARIABLE_NAME=VALUE`.  
3. Ensure that no one else can view this file by running `chmod 700 ~/env.txt`.
4. Install docker and docker-compose.

## Run a local instance
1. Run `chmod +x local_instance.sh` to give the shell script execution privileges.
2. Then execute the shell script by typing `./local_instance.sh`
3. Navigate to `http://localhost/api/v1/ui/` to view your swagger instance.
3. You can use `Control + C` to stop the local instance.

# OpenAPI auto generated documentation
## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m openapi_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/ui/
```

Your OpenAPI definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/openapi.json
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t openapi_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 openapi_server
```
